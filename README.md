# Protein-Family-Classification-Random-Forest
Protein Family Classification prediction using Random Forest and TF-IDF

Classification of protein families based on their sequence of aminoacids using Random Forest
This notebook is based on the work found here:

Using data from:

https://www.kaggle.com/shahir/protein-data-set

Where Neural Network (NN) is used to perform the prediction. This notebook sustitutes the NN with Random Forest (RF) together with tf-idf representation showing a similar performance (accuracy: 0.63) to the most complex NN when classifing only the 10 most common families.
